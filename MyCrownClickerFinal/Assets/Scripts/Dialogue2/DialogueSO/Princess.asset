  - Oh my, what do you have there?
  - Wow... what a beautiful crown! Oh? It's for me? Why thank you so much sir!
  - How rude of me. I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Rosie. It has been a
    honor to make your acquaintance!
  - It was lovely running in to you! Again, thank you very much for the beautiful
    crown. I really must get going. However, I hope that we see each other soon.
    I have a feeling that we will... ;) Until next time soilder!
